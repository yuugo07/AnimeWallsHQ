# AnimeWallsHQ Development Log

## Phase 2: Backend & Data Layer (The Engine Room ⚙️)

### Current Actions:
- **Cloudflare Worker Setup:**
  - **Objective:** Create a secure proxy to handle Telegram API requests, keeping the bot token secret.
  - **Manual Steps for User:**
    1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and create a new Worker.
    2. Name the worker (e.g., `animewalls-proxy`).
    3. In the worker's settings, navigate to "Variables" and add a new "Secret Variable".
    4. Name the secret `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and paste your Telegram Bot Token as the value.
    5. I will provide the worker script to be pasted into the Cloudflare Worker editor.

- **Telegram Bot Setup:**
  - **Objective:** Create a bot and get the necessary credentials.
  - **Manual Steps for User:**
    1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
    2. Start a chat and use the `/newbot` command.
    3. Follow the prompts to name your bot. You will receive a **Bot Token**.
    4. Add your new bot as an administrator to your wallpaper channel with "Read Messages" permission.
    5. Get your channel's ID. You can often get this by using another bot like `@userinfobot` and forwarding a message from the channel to it. The ID will be a negative number (e.g., `-1001234567890`).

### Completed Actions:
- Created the Cloudflare worker script in `worker.js`.
- **Room Database:**
    - Defined `WallpaperEntity` in `data/local/model/WallpaperEntity.kt`.
    - Created `WallpaperDao` in `data/local/dao/WallpaperDao.kt`.
    - Created `AppDatabase` in `data/local/AppDatabase.kt`.
- **Retrofit:**
    - Created `ApiService` interface in `data/remote/ApiService.kt`.
    - Created `TelegramResponse` and related models in `data/remote/model/TelegramResponse.kt`.
- **Repository:**
    - Created `WallpaperRepository` in `data/WallpaperRepository.kt`.

### Completed Actions:
- **Dependency Injection (Hilt):**
    - Configured `app/build.gradle.kts` to read secrets from `local.properties`.
    - Created `AppModule` to provide dependencies for Database, DAO, and ApiService.
    - Created `AnimeWallsHQApplication` and updated `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### Completed Actions:
- Implemented the data fetching logic in `WallpaperRepository`.

### Next Steps:
- Commit and push changes to GitHub.
- Begin Phase 3: UI/UX Development.
